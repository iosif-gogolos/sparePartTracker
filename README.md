# sparePartTracker
The project is a progressive web application called "sparePartTracker" used to record spare parts that have been damaged or incorrectly sent to a repair location. It allows users to:

1. Add details about spare parts, including license plate, part number, description, complaint date, reason, price, remarks, and whether a credit is available.
2. Upload and preview images of the spare parts.
3. View a dashboard with statistics and recommendations.
4. Search, edit, and delete spare part entries.
5. Paginate through the list of spare parts.
6. Export the list of spare parts and their images as a ZIP file.
7. Import spare part data from CSV or XLSX files.
